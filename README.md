# JavascriptMeetup
These are the two websites I displayed during my presentation at Javascript meetup-38 at headout,Bangalore. 

This project involves building an object detection web application using TensorFlow.js. The web application makes use of an object detection model that has been trained on thousands of different objects. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for object detection, allowing users to upload images and quickly receive accurate object detection results.

The object detection model used in this project is built using the TensorFlow framework, a popular open-source library for building and training machine learning models. The model is pre-trained on a large dataset of images, allowing it to detect a wide variety of objects accurately. To deploy this model in a web application, the TensorFlow.js library is used. TensorFlow.js is a powerful library that allows developers to run machine learning models directly in the browser.

To make the object detection web application accessible to users, the web app is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform. Heroku is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale web applications quickly and easily. This makes it a great choice for hosting the object detection web application and ensuring that it is always available to users.

Overall, the object detection web application using TensorFlow.js is a powerful and user-friendly tool for object detection. By leveraging the power of machine learning and the convenience of web-based deployment, developers can create highly sophisticated and accessible applications that provide value to users in various industries. The code for this project can be found on the GitHub repository provided in the link.
